        'yield' and 'await' are the only two primitives you need to create
        'Pipe's.  Because 'Pipe' is a monad, you can assemble them using
        ordinary @do@ notation.  Since 'Pipe' is also a monad transformer, you
        can use 'lift' to invoke the base monad.  For example:

> check :: Pipe a a IO r
> check = forever $ do
>     x <- await
>     lift $ putStrLn $ "Can " ++ (show x) ++ " pass?"
>     ok <- lift $ read <$> getLine
>     when ok (yield x)

        There are two possible category implementations for 'Pipe':

        ['Lazy' composition]

            * Use as little input as possible

            * Ideal for infinite input streams that never need finalization

        ['Strict' composition]

            * Use as much input as possible

            * Ideal for finite input streams that need finalization

        Both category implementations enforce the category laws:

        * Composition is associative (within each instance).  This is not
          merely associativity of monadic effects, but rather true
          associativity.  The result of composition produces identical
          composite 'Pipe's regardless of how you group composition.

        * 'id' is the identity 'Pipe'.  Composing a 'Pipe' with 'id' returns the
          original pipe.

        Both categories prioritize downstream effects over upstream effects.

        I provide convenience functions for composition that take care of
        newtype wrapping and unwrapping.  For example:

> p1 <+< p2 = unLazy $ Lazy p1 <<< Lazy p2

        '<+<' and '<-<' correspond to '<<<' from @Control.Category@

        '>+>' and '>+>' correspond to '>>>' from @Control.Category@

        '<+<' and '>+>' use 'Lazy' composition (Mnemonic: + for optimistic
        evaluation)

        '<-<' and '>->' use 'Strict' composition (Mnemonic: - for pessimistic
        evaluation)

        However, the above operators won't work with 'id' because they work on
        'Pipe's whereas 'id' is a newtype on a 'Pipe'.  However, both 'Category'
        instances share the same 'id' implementation:

> instance Category (Lazy m r) where
>     id = Lazy $ pipe id
>     ....
> instance Category (Strict m r) where
>     id = Strict $ pipe id
>     ...

        So if you need an identity 'Pipe' that works with the above convenience
        operators, you can use 'idP' which is just @pipe id@.

    The base type for pipes

    [@a@] The type of input received from upstream pipes

    [@b@] The type of output delivered to downstream pipes

    [@m@] The base monad

    [@r@] The type of the monad's final result

    The Pipe type is partly inspired by Mario Blazevic's Coroutine in his
    concurrency article from Issue 19 of The Monad Reader and partly inspired by
    the Trace data type from \"A Language Based Approach to Unifying Events and
    Threads\".

data Pipe a b m r =
    Pure r                     -- pure = Pure
  | M     (m   (Pipe a b m r)) -- Monad
  | Await (a -> Pipe a b m r ) -- ((->) a) Functor
  | Yield (b,   Pipe a b m r ) -- ((,)  b) Functor
{- I could have factored Pipe as:

data Computation f r = Pure r | F (f (Computation f r))
data PipeF a b m r = Await (a -> r) | Yield (b, r) | M (m r)
newtype Pipe a b m r = P { unP :: Computation (PipeF a b m) r }

   This makes the Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances much simpler at the
   expense of making the Category instances *much* harder to follow because of
   excessive newtype and constructor wrapping/unwrapping.  Since the Category
   instance is the meat of the library, I opted to in-line PipeF into
   computation to make it much simpler.  It's a shame, because the Computation
   type is very useful in its own right and I will probably create a separate
   library around it. -}
